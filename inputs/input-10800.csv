1388699133670662146,@visaraj @MukulAgarwal66 Oxygen consumption has gone up by 10x in individual Hospitals. Even captive plants are not able to general or supply the oxygen &amp; depend on liquid oxygen tanks. Each high flo patient requires 75000trs of oxygen per day. Just to give a perspective 1 jumbo cylinder is 8000 ltr.
