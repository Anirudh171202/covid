1389628589692186627,@Tejasvi_Surya  We need something similar for managing the oxygen shortage. There has to be an Audit on how much oxygen was provided and also protocols on supply of oxygen.  Without these check and balances you will keep supplying oxygen and there will be a shortage  https://t.co/DhnFLGqw2U

1388722938703081472,The NZ mission asks the INC for oxygen cylinders.  The INC magically finds cylinders at a time when even hospitals are facing an acute shortage.
