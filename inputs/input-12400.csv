1388422748406382593,Visited one more station and people are standing in queue since the last 12+ hours there.  While some people are easily getting oxygen filled from the back gate.

1388581383753191426,@GauravPandhi To Pvt hospitals first so that Paid vaccination will be in full swing. Free vaccination can wait until Chunawala gets enough to fund his ‚Äúphilanthropic gesture‚Äù. Why on this earth he is not apologising for that idiotic tweet ?
1388911949220515844,@narendramodi Please open vaccination for 18+ ppl. I dont understand why hospital are doing 45+ when clearly not many  are booking. For 18+ in certain hospitals its already booked for 15 days. How come some private hospitals are giving for 18+ and all govt for 45+. #VaccineForAll
